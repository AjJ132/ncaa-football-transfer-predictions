# Quarterback Transfer Prediction Model: Objectives and Challenges

## Project Objectives

1. **Primary Goal**: Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of college football quarterbacks transferring to another school in the upcoming season.

2. **Time Series Approach**: Utilize historical data from multiple seasons to capture trends and patterns in a quarterback's career that might indicate an increased likelihood of transfer.

3. **Actionable Insights**: Provide college football programs with a tool to anticipate potential quarterback transfers, allowing for better roster management and recruitment planning.

4. **Performance Metrics**: Achieve a balance between precision and recall in identifying potential transfers, with a focus on minimizing false negatives (missed transfer predictions).

## Current Challenges

1. **Severe Class Imbalance**: 
   - The dataset contains significantly fewer instances of transfers compared to non-transfers (76 transfers vs. 537 non-transfers in the current dataset).
   - This imbalance is causing the model to predict the majority class (non-transfer) for all instances, resulting in zero recall for the transfer class.

2. **Feature Relevance**: 
   - Current features may not be sufficiently predictive of transfer likelihood.
   - Need to identify and engineer features that better capture the factors influencing a quarterback's decision to transfer.

3. **Time Series Complexity**: 
   - Capturing the temporal aspects of a player's career and how they influence transfer decisions is challenging.
   - Need to effectively represent year-over-year changes and career trajectories in our feature set.

4. **Model Selection and Tuning**: 
   - The current model (ensemble of Random Forests with bagging) is not effectively learning to distinguish between transfers and non-transfers.
   - Need to explore alternative models and techniques that may be more suitable for this specific problem and data structure.

5. **Handling Rare Events**: 
   - Transfers can be considered rare events, which are typically challenging to predict.
   - May need to consider approaches specific to rare event prediction or anomaly detection.

6. **Performance Metric Selection**: 
   - Standard accuracy is misleading due to class imbalance.
   - Need to focus on metrics like ROC AUC, precision-recall curve, and F1 score, with possible emphasis on recall given the importance of not missing potential transfers.

7. **Data Quality and Quantity**: 
   - Ensuring we have comprehensive and accurate historical data for a large number of quarterbacks across multiple seasons.
   - Potential need for more data points to improve model performance, especially for the minority class (transfers).

8. **Interpretability**: 
   - Balancing model complexity and performance with the need for interpretable results that can provide actionable insights to football programs.

## Next Steps

1. Revisit feature engineering process, potentially incorporating domain expertise to create more predictive features.
2. Experiment with advanced techniques for handling class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE, adaptive synthetic sampling).
3. Explore alternative model architectures, including gradient boosting machines and possibly deep learning approaches.
4. Consider framing the problem as an anomaly detection task rather than binary classification.
5. Implement cross-validation to ensure model generalization and robustness.
6. Develop a more nuanced evaluation framework that considers the practical implications of false positives vs. false negatives in this specific context.

By addressing these challenges and following these next steps, we aim to develop a more effective and reliable model for predicting quarterback transfers, providing valuable insights to college football programs.
