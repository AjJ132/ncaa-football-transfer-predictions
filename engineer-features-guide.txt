Understandable. Feature engineering can be challenging, 
especially when you feel you've already included the most obvious factors. 
Let's brainstorm some potential new features that could be relevant for predicting player 
transfers in college football. I'll suggest ideas based on common reasons players might transfer 
and factors that could influence their decision:

Playing Time Metrics:

Percentage of snaps played in previous season
Change in playing time from previous year to current year
Ratio of player's stats to team's total (e.g., player's passing yards / team's total passing yards)


Team Performance:

Team's win-loss record in previous season
Change in team's record from previous year
Team's conference ranking
Bowl game appearances or lack thereof


Depth Chart Position:

Player's position on depth chart (if available)
Number of players ahead on depth chart in same position


Coaching Changes:

Binary feature for head coach change in last year
Binary feature for position coach change
New coach's history of using transfer portal


Academic Factors (if available):

Player's major
Academic performance metrics
Availability of specific academic programs at current school


Geographic Factors:

Distance from hometown to current school
Number of schools closer to hometown in player's conference


NFL Draft Prospects:

Draft eligibility status
Pre-season draft rankings (if available)


Social Media Indicators:

Sentiment analysis of player's social media posts
Frequency of posts about team or school


Injury History:

Games missed due to injury in previous season
Cumulative injury metric over college career


Team Offensive/Defensive Scheme:

Compatibility of player's style with team's scheme
Changes in team's offensive/defensive coordinators


Competitive Metrics:

Quarterback rating relative to conference average
Performance in big games or rivalry matches


Financial Factors (for grad transfers):

Availability of scholarship for extra year
Potential NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) opportunities at current vs. potential schools


Team Discipline Issues:

Number of team suspensions or disciplinary actions
Player's personal conduct record


Redshirt Status:

Whether player was redshirted
Years of eligibility remaining


Transfer Portal Trends:

Number of transfers from player's position in previous year
Overall transfer rate for player's conference or division


Program Stability:

NCAA investigations or sanctions
Changes in athletic director or key administrative positions


Teammate Relationships:

Number of teammates from same high school or hometown
Turnover rate of players in same position group


Post-Season Performance:

Player's stats in bowl games or conference championships
Team's post-season success or failure



To implement these:

Assess data availability for each potential feature.
Create new columns in your dataset for the features you can reliably calculate or obtain.
Use domain knowledge to combine or transform existing features into more meaningful metrics.
Consider interaction terms between important features.
Normalize or standardize new numerical features as needed.
Use feature selection techniques (e.g., mutual information, feature importance from tree-based models) 
to identify which new features are most predictive.

Remember, the goal is to capture factors that might influence a player's decision to transfer. 
Even if you can't implement all of these, adding a few relevant new features could significantly 
improve your model's predictive power.
